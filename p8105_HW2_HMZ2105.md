## Problem 1:

This problem uses data regarding political party of the president and
economic markers compiled by five-thirty-eight in order to show how p
hacking can occur.

First will import pols_month which includes data regarding politician
party affilication. Will code 2 in president variable as other as not
sure what the 2 corresponds to.

``` r
pols_month_df = 
  read_csv("data/pols-month.csv") |>
separate(mon, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-") |>
  mutate(
    year = as.integer(year),
    month = as.integer(month),
    month_name = month.abb[month]
  ) |>
   mutate(
  month = case_match(
    month, 1 ~ 'Jan', 2 ~ 'Feb', 3~ 'Mar', 4~ 'Apr', 5~ 'May', 6~ 'Jun',
  7~ 'Jul', 8~ 'Aug', 9~ 'Sep', 10~'Oct', 11~ 'Nov', 12~'Dec'))  |>
    mutate(
    president = recode(prez_gop, "0" = "dem", "1" = "gop", "2" = "other")) |>
   select(year, month, everything(), -day, -starts_with("prez")) 
```

    ## Rows: 822 Columns: 9
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## dbl  (8): prez_gop, gov_gop, sen_gop, rep_gop, prez_dem, gov_dem, sen_dem, r...
    ## date (1): mon
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

Next import and clean snp file which contains data on Standard & Poor’s
stock market index (S&P).

``` r
snp_df = 
  read_csv("data/snp.csv") |>
separate(date, into = c("month", "day", "year"), sep = "/")  |>
      mutate(year = as.integer(year),
         month = as.integer(month),
         day = as.integer(day)) |>
  mutate(
  month = case_match(
    month, 1 ~ 'Jan', 2 ~ 'Feb', 3~ 'Mar', 4~ 'Apr', 5~ 'May', 6~ 'Jun',
  7~ 'Jul', 8~ 'Aug', 9~ 'Sep', 10~'Oct', 11~ 'Nov', 12~'Dec')) |>
  select(year, month, everything(), -day)  
```

    ## Rows: 787 Columns: 2
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (1): date
    ## dbl (1): close
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

``` r
snp_df$year = ifelse(snp_df$year >= "50" & snp_df$year <= "99", paste0("19", snp_df$year), snp_df$year)

snp_df$year = ifelse(snp_df$year >= "00" & snp_df$year <= "23", paste0("20", snp_df$year), snp_df$year)

snp_df$year <- as.numeric(snp_df$year)

snp_df$year <- as.integer(snp_df$year)
```

Next we import and clean the unemployment dataset.

``` r
unemployment_df = 
  read_csv("data/unemployment.csv") |>
rename(year = Year) |>
  pivot_longer(
    Jan:Dec, 
    names_to = "month",
    values_to = "unemployment_percentage"
  )
```

    ## Rows: 68 Columns: 13
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## dbl (13): Year, Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

Next we merge the datasets.

``` r
five_thirty_eight_df = 
  left_join(pols_month_df, snp_df) |>
  left_join(x = _, y = unemployment_df)
```

    ## Joining with `by = join_by(year, month)`
    ## Joining with `by = join_by(year, month)`

The pools_month data has 822 observations and 10 variables. The data
covers the years 1947 to 2015. The dataset shows the party affiliation
for politicians and the year that they were in office.

The snp data shows the value that the S&P closed for various dates. The
dataset has 787 observations and 3 variables. It ranges from years 0 to
201999.

The unemployment data detailes the unemployment rate from years 1948 to
2015. The dataset has 816 observations and 3 variables.

For whavever reason once the data is merged the close values from the
snp dataset are all missing.

## Problem 2: Clean Trash Wheel Datasets

This problem uses the dataset Trash Wheel which includes data regarding
trash that was removed from the Inner Harbor in Baltimore, Maryland.

First, import Trash Wheel dataset, specifically sheet Mr Trash Wheel,
and clean. We need to skip column 1 as it contains pictures, not include
blank columns, and also not import the last row as it includes data
summary elements. We also need to convert dumpert variable to numeric as
it is coded as characters.

``` r
mr_trash_df = 
  read_excel("data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx",
  sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", skip = 1, range = cell_cols(1:14)) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  subset(!is.na(dumpster) & dumpster != "") |>
  mutate(trash_wheel = "Mr", year = as.numeric(year)) |> 
  relocate(trash_wheel)
```

Calculate new homes powered column based on note that 1 ton garbage =
500KW of electricity and 30KW powers 1 house.

``` r
mr_trash_df = 
mutate (mr_trash_df, homes_powered = (weight_tons*500)/30)
```

Next, import Prof. Trash Wheel dataset, clean, and create new
homes_powered variable.

``` r
prof_trash_df = 
  read_excel("data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx",
  sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel", skip = 1, range = cell_cols(1:13)) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  subset(!is.na(dumpster) & dumpster != "") |>
  mutate(trash_wheel = "Prof", year = as.numeric(year)) |> 
  relocate(trash_wheel) |>
mutate (homes_powered = (weight_tons*500)/30)
```

Next, import Gwynnda Trash Wheel dataset, clean, and create new
homes_powered variable.

``` r
gwynnda_trash_df = 
  read_excel("data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx",
  sheet = "Gwynnda Trash Wheel", skip = 1, range = cell_cols(1:11)) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  subset(!is.na(dumpster) & dumpster != "") |>
  mutate(trash_wheel = "Gwynnda", year = as.numeric(year)) |> 
  relocate(trash_wheel) |>
mutate (homes_powered = (weight_tons*500)/30)
```

Combine all 3 trash wheels dataframes.

``` r
trash_wheel_df = 
  bind_rows(mr_trash_df, prof_trash_df, gwynnda_trash_df)
```

The dataframe Trash Wheel consists of combined data from Mister Trash
Wheel, Professor Trash Wheel and Gwynnda Trash Wheel and details the
weight of trash and type of trash that these wheels have collected from
2014 to 2023. There are 845 observations. The variables in the dataframe
are trash_wheel, dumpster, month, year, date, weight_tons,
volume_cubic_yards, plastic_bottles, polystyrene, cigarette_butts,
glass_bottles, plastic_bags, wrappers, sports_balls, homes_powered. The
total weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel is 216.26. The
total weight of trash collected by Mr. Trash Wheel is 1875.1. And the
total weight of trash collected by Gwynnda Trash Wheel is 451.65. Mr
Trash Wheel powered 53.5131279 homes on average, Professor Trash Wheel
powered 34.0031447 on average, and Gwynnda Trash Wheel powered
48.5645161 homes on average. The total number of cigarette butts
collected by Gwynnda Trash Wheel in July 2021 was 1.63^{4}.

## Problem 3

This problem includes the dataset MCI and amyloid which was collcted as
part of an observation study and incldues biomarkers from patients who
developed Alzheimer’s disease, as measured by development of mild
cognitive impairment (MCI).

First import MCI and begin the cleaning process. Will skip the first row
as this contains notes about the dataset. Recode age to be male (1) vs
female (0) and presence of apoe4 as carrier (1) vs non_carrier (0).
Change”.” to missing values (i.e. NA) in age_at_onset variable. Rename
education to education_years, current_age to age_baseline, and
age_at_onset to age_MCI. Make education_years numeric. Specify that this
is from the MCI dataset by adding a column called MCI. Also will change
age_MCI to a numeric value.

``` r
MCI_df = 
  read_csv("data/MCI_baseline.csv", skip = 1) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |>
mutate(
 sex = case_match(
    sex, 0 ~ 'female', 1 ~ 'male'),
 apoe4 = case_match(
   apoe4, 1 ~ "carrier",0 ~ "non_carrier"),
 age_at_onset = ifelse(
   age_at_onset == ".", NA, age_at_onset)
 ) |>
    rename(education_years = education, age_baseline = current_age, age_MCI = age_at_onset) |>
  mutate(mci = "mci") |> 
  mutate(education_years = as.numeric(education_years), age_MCI = as.numeric(age_MCI))
```

    ## Rows: 483 Columns: 6
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (1): Age at onset
    ## dbl (5): ID, Current Age, Sex, Education, apoe4
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

The study recruited 483 participants. The average age of all
participants at baseline was 65.0467909. There are 211 females and 272
males. The average education in years of all participants is 16.3975155.
The proportion of women who are apoe4 carriers are 0.2985782 and the
proportion of men who are apoe4 carriers are 0.3014706.

However, there are patients who developed MCI prior to being enrolled in
the study (n= 94) and also missing participants (n=386). Will remove
these participants and then redo data description.

``` r
MCI_df = 
na.omit(MCI_df) |>
  filter(age_MCI >= age_baseline)
```

After removing these patients, there are now 94 participants.The average
age of participants with MCI at baseline was 65.5542553 with range of
58.1, 71.6. There are 45 females with MCI and 49 males with MCI. The
average education in years of participants with MCI is 16.5531915. Among
participants with MCI, the proportion of women who are apoe4 carriers
are 0.6666667 and the proportion of men who are apoe4 carriers are
0.6122449.

First import the amyloid biomarkers dataset and begin the cleaning
process. This dataset includes amyloid measurements at various time
points throughout the study. Will skip the first row as this contains
notes about the dataset. Rename baseline to time_0. Then pivot data so
that each amyloid and time has its own column. Next rename study_id
column to id in order to match MCI dataset. Change amyloid values to
numeric from character. And also add in column called amyloid in
preparation for merging.

``` r
amyloid_df = 
  read_csv("data/mci_amyloid.csv", skip = 1) |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
    rename (time_0 = baseline) |>
pivot_longer(
    time_0:time_8,
    names_to = "time",
    values_to = "amyloid_values"
  ) |>
  rename(id = study_id) |>
  mutate (amyloid = "amyloid") |>
  mutate(amyloid_values = as.numeric(amyloid_values))
```

    ## Rows: 487 Columns: 6
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (5): Baseline, Time 2, Time 4, Time 6, Time 8
    ## dbl (1): Study ID
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

    ## Warning: There was 1 warning in `mutate()`.
    ## ℹ In argument: `amyloid_values = as.numeric(amyloid_values)`.
    ## Caused by warning:
    ## ! NAs introduced by coercion

This dataset contains data on for 487 participants. However, there are
147 participants with at least 1 missing time value. The time points
collected are time_0, time_2, time_4, time_6, time_8.

Next will determine whether some participants are only present in one
dataset or both. Will make a dataset that only includes participants
present in both sets, and another dataset that contains all patients.

``` r
MCI_both_df = 
  inner_join(amyloid_df, MCI_df, by="id")

MCI_full_df =
  full_join(amyloid_df, MCI_df) |>
  subset (!duplicated(id)) |>
  select (id, amyloid, mci)
```

    ## Joining with `by = join_by(id)`

There are 91 participants in the new dataset. There are 396 participants
who appear in amyloid but not MCI and 3 participants who appear in mci
but not amyloid.

Among participants in the joined dataset, the average baseline age is
65.6879121 and age at onset is 70.4659341. There are 43 females. The
number of apoe4 carriers is 59. There are 27 participants with at least
1 missing time value.

Export dataset

``` r
write_csv(MCI_both_df, "data/MCI_both_df.csv")
```
