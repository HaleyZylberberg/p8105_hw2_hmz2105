## Problem 2: Clean Trash Wheel Datasets

First, import Mr. Trash Wheel dataset and clean.
```{r}
Mr_trash_df = 
  read_excel("data/202207 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx",
  sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", skip = 1, n_max=547) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  select (- x15, - x16, - month, - year) |>
  rename (weight_total = weight_tons, 
          volume_total = volume_cubic_yards) |>
  mutate(trash_wheel = "Mr Trash Wheel") |> 
  relocate(trash_wheel) |>
   pivot_longer(
    plastic_bottles:sports_balls,
    names_to = "litter_type",
    values_to = "litter_amount"
  )
```

Calculate new homes powered column.
```{r}
mutate (Mr_trash_df, homes_powered = (weight_total*500)/30)
```
